## Project Overview

This project focuses on executing an end-to-end data engineering project for real-time stock market data using Kafka. The goal is to showcase the implementation of a robust data pipeline to handle the ingestion, processing, and analysis of real-time stock market data. The project utilizes various technologies including Python, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Apache Kafka, Glue, Athena, and SQL.

## Architecture

Python: Used as the programming language for developing the data engineering pipeline.
Amazon Web Services (AWS): Provides the cloud infrastructure and services required for the project.
S3 (Simple Storage Service): Used for storing the dataset and intermediate data.
Athena: Enables querying and analyzing data stored in S3 using SQL.
Glue Crawler: Automatically discovers and catalogs the data for efficient processing.
Glue Catalog: Stores metadata about the datasets.
EC2: Provides compute resources for processing the data.
Apache Kafka: Utilized for real-time data streaming.
